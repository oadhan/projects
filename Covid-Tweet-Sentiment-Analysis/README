Purpose: A year after the breakout of Covid-19, this project aimed to explore the correlation
between general public mental health and the number of cases of Covid throughout the first year 
of the pandemic. Personally we had all experienced the increase in anxiety and depressions
throughout the pandemic and wanted to explore is this was reflected in the general public.

Method: We aimed to analyze whether this correlation existed by conducting a sentiment analysis 
on a corpus of tweets mentioning Covid from March 2020 to January 2021. Please see the report in
the folder for more details. 

Datasets: 
1. total_tweets.csv
- Source: Cited from IEEE DataPort (Lamsal, 2022)
- We hydrated this dataset by requesting the contents of these tweets using a Twitter API
- NOTE: This dataset cannot be found in this repository due to size limitations. Please reach
out if you'd like further information or access

2. States.csv
- Source: NYC Open Data, 2022
- Holds the number of new Covid-19 cases in New York state from 2/28/2020 to 5/01/2021
