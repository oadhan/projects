        <h2>Welcome to Your Digital Reality Check</h2>
        <p>
          Social media platforms are designed for engagement. With addictive loops driven by likes, scrolls, and notifications, social media doesn't just consume your time, it fundamentally changes how your brain works by taking over neural reward pathways, replacing the drive for innate and essential rewards such as water, food, and sleep just as other addictive substances, such as opiates, stimulants, and alcohol, do. </p>
          
       <p>The usage cycle leads to behavioral changes during the withdrawal period, which can then lead to prolonged mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety<sup>1</sup>.</p> 
        <p>
          This project explores this complex web of psychological impacts through data as seen through various public health surveys across the globe.
