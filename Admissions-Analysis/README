Purpose: Analyze a dataset of students from various middle schools who applied to the High School for Health Professions and Human 
Services (HSPHS) in New York, NY and their application result to understand which variables best predicted their admission to HSPHS.
This analysis was done to provide recommendations to middle schools on what changes can be made to increase their students' chances
of being admitted to HSPHS.

Method: I first checked the correlation between various quantitative factors (ex. test performace, student to teacher ratio, etc.) and
qualitative factors (ex. student perception of their school, trust, etc.) of each middle school with their admission rate. 
I did this through correlation metrics and hypothesis testing. I then fitted regression models to see which factors had the most impact
on admisson.

- quanititative: school_name, applications, per_pupil_spending, avg_class_size, asian_percent, black_percent, hispanic_percent, multiple_percent,
white_percent, disability_percentage, poverty_percent, ESL_percent, school_size
- qualitative (strongly disagree = 1, strongly agree = 5): rigorous_instruction, collaborative_teachers, supportive_enviroment, 
effective_school_leadership, strong_family_community_ties, trust, student_achievement
y:
